1-9 / 100 000;Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) resulting from mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 is the most common form of both hereditary breast and ovarian cancers and occurs in all ethnic and racial populations. The overall prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutations is estimated to be from 1:400 to 1:800 [Ford et al 1994, Claus et al 1996, Whittemore et al 1997], but varies depending on ethnicity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   2

Congenital deafness affects 1 in 1,000 births;Congenital deafness affects 1 in 1,000 births.;DFNB1 accounts for approximately 50% of congenital, severe-to-profound, autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss in the United States, France, Britain, and New Zealand/Australia [Denoyelle et al 1997, Green et al 1999]. Its approximate prevalence in the general population is 14:100,000, based on the following calculation: the incidence of congenital hereditary hearing impairment is 1:2000 neonates, of which 70% have nonsyndromic hearing loss. Seventy-five to 80% of cases of nonsyndromic hearing loss are autosomal recessive: of these, 50% result from GJB2 mutations. Thus, 5:10,000 x 0.7 x 0.8 x 0.5 = 14:100,000.     2
