   4 Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder with a prevalence of 1/30,000, and a carrier frequency of 1/90.
   4 The precise incidence and prevalence of CCD, considered to be the most frequently occurring congenital myopathy, are unknown.
   4 Rare - 63 per million

   2 The overall prevalence of hereditary neuropathies is estimated at approximately 3:10,000 population. About 30% of these individuals (1:10,000) may have CMT2. The prevalence of the various subtypes of CMT2 is unknown
   2 The frequency of NBIA is estimated to be approximately 1-3/1,000,000 individuals.
   2 Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) resulting from mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 is the most common form of both hereditary breast and ovarian cancers and occurs in all ethnic and racial populations. The overall prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutations is estimated to be from 1:400 to 1:800 [Ford et al 1994, Claus et al 1996, Whittemore et al 1997], but varies depending on ethnicity.
   2 DI-CMTB is a rare cause of CMT. Up to 3.4% of CMT is caused by a DNM2 mutation
   2 DFNB1 accounts for approximately 50% of congenital, severe-to-profound, autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss in the United States, France, Britain, and New Zealand/Australia [Denoyelle et al 1997, Green et al 1999]. Its approximate prevalence in the general population is 14:100,000, based on the following calculation: the incidence of congenital hereditary hearing impairment is 1:2000 neonates, of which 70% have nonsyndromic hearing loss. Seventy-five to 80% of cases of nonsyndromic hearing loss are autosomal recessive: of these, 50% result from GJB2 mutations. Thus, 5:10,000 x 0.7 x 0.8 x 0.5 = 14:100,000.
   2 Currently, CMT4A is considered the most frequent of all autosomal recessive forms of CMT.    Molecular genetic testing has shown that the following proportion of individuals with CMT have two disease-causing GDAP1 alleles:    1% - 15% individuals depending on the studied population
